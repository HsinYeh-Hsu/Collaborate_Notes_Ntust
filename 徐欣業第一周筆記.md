### Virtual Machine(VM)虛擬機器
- What is VM?
    - a software computer used as emulation of an actual physical computer
    - can run multi-tenant on on physical computer
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/fDHwvgH.png)
- VM
    - hypervisor
        - VMware vSphere
        - Microsoft Hyper-V
    - OS(operating system)
        - Ubuntu
            - Linux system
            - open source
    - VirtualBox
        - work on Windows, Linux
- Virtual Machine compare to Physical Servers
    - stable
        - easy to find the problem
        - VMs are independ to each other, so that if one of the VM get destroy.
        - problem can be remove easier than physical computer
            - build a new VM and restore the entire VM at a DR site
    - easy to manage
        -  recovery process can be very fast, because we don't need to restore the physical computer.
        -  can Customize system size
    - cheaper
        - because most of the physical system have a lot of resource isn't use, VM can take care of the underutilized system.
    - not easy to control.?
        - need profassional skill to control.
    - easy to remove server data to different server.
    - physical server environment need move to another location,is more difficult.
        -  need to build up the same environment step by step as the original one.

### GitHub & Git
- Distributed Version Control System(分散式版本控制系統)
    - repository(資料庫)
        - History
            - can tell the user when the code get change, and what change between two code.
            - can check all the document(code, picture,...)
        - can change what you want to public immediately
        - can storage multi-version's project in one list.
    - multi-person collaboration
- provide Cloud storage save our project 
- compare to centralized Version Control System(集中式版本控制)
    - diversify risk, everybody have there own code in there own device

- how to use
    -  Create a new repository
        -  set owner name

### Docker
- software platfrom
    - Build, test, and deploy applications quickly
    - packages software into standardlized units called containers
        - let user easy to transplant to other deivice
    -  provide flexable cloud sevice
- How it work 
    - Docker container
    - Dockerfile
        - A order that contain how to build the Docker image
        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/tsbdyJR.png)
    - Docker image
        -  Docker container's blueprint
        -  Contain Docker file and code, code version
        - Docker ignore: will not be upload

- Docker vs VM
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/kkApV76.png)
    - Docker
        - Take up less resources
        - High resource utilization
            - Share resource
        - run fast
    - VM
       - when user develop in different OS or version, VM need to install all the OS and version
       - waste a lot of time
       - OS operating needs lots of time and complexity

### Database(DB)
- organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system, usually control by database management system(DBMS).
- data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized.
- structured query language(SQL)
    - SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control.

### Linode
- Virtual Private Server(VPS)
    - uses virtualization software to partition physical servers into multiple virtual servers each having the ability to run its own Operating System (OS) and applications.
- Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)
    - let user easy to use one device to  switch and control multi-devices.
    - save space and cost savings...
- provide different Linux system for user
    - ex. Alpine、Arch Linux、Centos、Debian、Fedora、Gentoo、Slackware、Ubuntu、openSUSE
    - didn't provide windows, need to prepare for itself.

## LineBot 
### heroku
- PaaS(platform as a service)
    - online computing services
    - provide platform-based service
        - User don't need to manage and control online platform-based
        - User only need take care of app.
- a platform that allow user to public online
- heroku have provide Dyno to let the user run faster
    - Dyno: virtual machine,
    - need $$$
- AWS(Amazon Web Services)
### ngrok
- Reverse Proxy(反向代理伺服器)
    - Used as a proxy on the server side
    - Clients only knows proxy's IP
    - Clients can use reverse server to access resources on different back-end servers
- public localhost server
