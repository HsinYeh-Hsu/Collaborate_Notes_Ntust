### HTTP & HTTPS
- HTTP(HyperText Transfer Protocol)
    - Work on Application layer(網路層)， allow user to communicate data on WWW(World Wide Web).
    - first interactive, text-based web browser
    - Base on TCP/IP, use to be a connector between server and browser.
    - easy to read, expand
    - can not memorize data on website， so we need to use cookie to create memory space.

- HTTP VS HTTPS
    - 'S' ==secure

    -[HTTP wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#HTTP/1.1_response_messages)

### UDP(User Datagram Protocol) & TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)
- What is UDP?
    - Communicate protocol for internet and it is time-sensitive transmissions
    - Because it is not formally transmit, so it's very fast, but it's easy to lost the packets.
    - not stable, because of data can't send sequential. But it's faster than TCP.
- How does UDP work?
    - Sends packets directly to a target computer, without establishing a connection first, indicating the order of said packets, or checking whether they arrived as intended.
    - Can send sequential, but is slower, because it need to "Shakehand" at first.
- UDP 應用
    - WebRTC(web Real-Time Communication)
        - Browser don't need to install plugin to do peer-to-peer's communicate.
        - Browser: Safari, Edge...
        - Open Source
        - Provide mult-player to use.
        - Use UDP to streaming, so it's very fast
- How does TCP work?
    - TCP communication, the two computers begin by establishing a connection via an automated process called a ‘handshake.’ Only once this handshake has been completed will one computer actually transfer data packets to the other.

### WebSocket
- What is WebSocket?
    - OSI: 7th layer, Application layer
    - based on TCP & HTTP protocol
    - Full - duplex, only need to 'handshake' one time, both client and user can communicate to each other at any time.
- Why is WebSocket?
    - Client can check the data by automatically ex. 30sec. refresh one time.
        - Waste bandwith
    -  Long-Polling:

        - ![](https://i.imgur.com/M9V8gNL.png)

- Websocket compare to HTTP
    - **Websocket** is faster than HTTP
    - **Websocket** is lighter than HTTP
    - Websocket will cut the transmit data at first, send it one by on, after receive all the data, then rebuild it.
    - HTTP will same the whole datas in one package.

### MQTT
- MQTT (MQ Telemetry Transport) : simple messaging protocol
	- can be used at different devices
	- lightweight, low bandwidth
	- topics
		- filter the data from different devices
		- can decide which topics to make public
	![](https://i.imgur.com/DQ4axTw.png)
	- MQTT broker
		- publish: Device_1 sends topic_1 to MQTT 
		- subscribe: Device_2 sends a subscription request for topic_1 to MQTT, and then gets data_1
			- Device_2 sends their request for topic_2 to MQTT, and then gets nothing

### RPC(Remote Procedure Call)
- Distributed computing
    - based on one computer and use internet to send project by part, and the computing data in different computer, after the calculation integate all the data.
    - cheap
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/917Z1GK.png)
- Communication protocol
- allow program to call other open-internet's computer address, to activate sub-function.

### Youtube music
- VLC media player
    - Open Source： is source code that is made freely available for possible modification and redistribution.
    - It's a multimedia player and framework that plays most multimedia files, and various streaming protocols.
    - Provide **Stream Protocol**
    - Muli-player
    - Can send by IPv4 & IPv6
    - ![](https://i.imgur.com/Kr9nisd.png)

- Youtube DL
    - Open Source.
    - Download form Github.
    - Made by python at first, but now they have Golang. 
    - No limit to download the data.
    - Support Download lots of different websites.
- Stream(串流)
    - Lets datas send one by one, not send as a package.
- Reference VLC
